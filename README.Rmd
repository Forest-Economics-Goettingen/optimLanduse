<a name="1. Einleitung">Introduction</a>
</h3>

The R package **optimLanduse** provides tools for easy and systematic applications of the robust multiobjective land-cover composition optimization approach of Knoke et al. (2016). It includes tools to determine the land-cover composition that best balances the multiple functions and services a landscape can provide, and tools for understanding and visualizing how these compromises are reasoned. The **README.md** below guides users through the application and highlights possible use-cases on the basis of a published data set. Illustrating the consequences of alternative ecosystem functions on the theoretically optimal landscape composition provides easily interpretable information for landscape modeling and decision making. The method is already established in land-cover optimization and has been applied in a couple of studies. More details about the theory, the definition of the formal optimization problem and also significant examples are listed in the <a href="#8. Literatur">literature</a> section

The package opens the approach of Knoke et al. (2016) to the community of landscape planners and provides opportunities for straightforward systematic or batch applications. To further enhance this, we have designed a graphical shiny dashboard for the package to get a quick idea of the functionalities of the package, see <http://134.76.17.50/optimlanduse_shiny/>.

<h3>
<a name="3. Input und Output">Package structure</a>
</h3>

This chapter provides a brief overview over the package functions. For detailed information about methodological background, functions, and workflow please refer to Husmann et al. (n.d.) listed in the <a href="#7. Suggested">suggested citation</a> section. Furthermore you can consider the respective help pages for more information. The function *lpSolveAPI()* comes from the **lpSolveAPI** package.

</p>

#### Initialization and Input

The *initScenario()* function combines the user settings with the data into an *optimLanduse*-object ready for solving. The following input data are required:

-   *coefTable*: The package is only capable of processing a long-oriented type of data structure. All combinations of land-cover (landUse) alternatives and indicators have to be listed vertically. Each row must contain the average expectation, the uncertainty, and the direction of the respective land-cover and indicator combination. The column names of the table must follow the expected nomenclature displayed below. You also find this format in the built-in example tables **exampleGosling.xlsx** or **exampleEmpty.xlsx**. All further columns will be dropped if passed.

<p align="center">
  <img width="673.4" height="298.2" src="./man/figures/exampleGraphic.png">
</p>

\| See the help files of the *exampleData()* and *initScenario()* functions for more details. An empty template (incl. predefined headings) \| can be accessed via the *exampleData("exampleEmpty.xlsx")* function. <br>

-   *uValue*: The argument for the uncertainty level ($f_u$, equation 4 in Husmann et al. (n.d.)). A higher uValue reflects a higher risk aversion of the decision maker. See the help file of the *initScenario* function for more details.

-   *optimisticRule*: Specifies whether the optimistic contributions of each indicator should be defined either directly by their average, or by their average plus their uncertainty (if more is better) or minus its uncertainty (if less is better). The former option is most frequently used in recent literature and therefore builds the default.

-   *fixDistance*: Optional numeric value that defines distinct uncertainty levels for the calculation of the uncertainty space and the averaged distances of a certain land-cover composition (see Equation 9 in Husmann et al. (n. d.)). Passing NA disables fixDistance. The uncertainty space is then defined by the uValue.

#### Solver and List with results

The *solveScenario()* function requires the initialized *optimLanduse*-object and only a few optional solver-specific arguments. As the solving process has no stochastic element, the calculation times depend almost entirely on the number of digits calculated.

-   *digitsPrecision*: Provides the only possibility for the user to influence the calculation time. As the solving process has no stochastic element, the calculation times depend almost entirely on the number of digits calculated.

-   *lowerBound* & *upperBound*: Optional bounds for the land-cover options. The lower bound must be 0 or a vector with lower bounds in the dimension of the land-cover options. The upper bound, respectively, 1 or a vector with upper bounds in the dimension of the land-cover options. Choosing 0 and 1 (the defaults) as boundaries for all decision variables, means that no land-cover alternative is forced into the portfolio and that no land-cover alternative is assigned a maximum.

The resulting *list with results* contains different Information of the optimization model. First the information of the *initScenario()* function are displayed again in this list. These include:

-   *scenarioSettings*: Data frame with *uValue* and *optimisticRule* used.
-   *scenarioTable*: Data frame with one row for each combination of worst-case and best-case outcomes of all indicators (thus the number of scenarios $N_S$ in Husmann et al (n.d.)). The columns contain certain relevant calculation steps of the optimization program. *adjSem\** are the uncertainty adjusted indicators ($R_{liu}$ in Husmann et al. (n.d.)). *minAdjSem* are the minimal uncertainty adjusted indicators $min(R_{liu})$ and $max(R_{liu})$ the maximal uncertainty adjusted indicators. diffAdjSem are the range between these uncertainties adjusted indicators $\delta_{\text{min,max}_{iu}}$.
-   *coefObjective*: The optimization program is translated into a linear program with $N_L$ (number of land-cover options) coefficients for the inner solution. The inner solution is solved using *lpSolveAPI*. *coefObjective* is the data frame that contains these coefficients.
-   *coefConstraing*: A data frame with the respective constraints for the inner solution solved by *lpsolveAPI*.
-   *distances*: The distance of each scenario to its own theoretically best-achievable contribution (reference). See equation 3 in Husmann et al. (n.d.).

This is followed by a summary of the results of the optimization:

-   *Î²*: The maximum distance of the worst performing scenario (equation 1 in Husmann et al. (n.d.)).
-   *landUse*: The resulting land-cover composition in the optimum.

#### Post-Processing

-   *calcPerfomance()*: Attaches the portfolio performances of all indicators and scenarios as data frame. The data can be used for straightforward visualization of the performance. The performance is defined as the distance to the maximum achievable level for each indicator and uncertainty scenario.

<a name="5. Beispielhafte Anwendung">Example application</a>
</h3>

We here present the basic workflow on a literature example. Aim of this chapter is to introduce the functionality of the packages' functions and to explain the relevant in- and output on the example of a use-case in Eastern Panama. The data of this study is accessible in the *Appendix A* of Gosling et al. (2020) and is also firmly integrated into the optimLanduse package. It can be accessed via *exampleData("exampleGosling.xlsx")*. The data integrated in the package comes already in the expected *optimLanduse* format, such that it can be used without any data processing.

Enriching agricultural farms with forest plantations has potential to enhance the ecosystem functioning of farms in Panama. Gosling et al. (2020) therefore used the optimization model presented here to understand smallholder farmers' perceptions and values of agroforestry systems. They identified 10 relevant indicators for a predefined set of land-cover alternatives, which represent the farmers' goals. A subsequent survey of farmers provided the empirical basis in the form of indicators' expectations (arithmetic mean) and uncertainties (standard error of the mean) for each land-cover alternative. Descriptions of the land-cover alternatives and indicators can be found in tables 1 and 2 in Gosling et al. (2020).

### Installing *optimLanduse*, Loading Required Packages and Importing the Data

```{r, results='hide',message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
# If not already installed
# install.packages("optimLanduse", repos = "https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/cran/")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
# Note: Not all of the following packages are automatically installed. 
# Manual installation could be required.
library(optimLanduse)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggsci)

# Loading the example data
path <- exampleData("exampleGosling.xlsx")
dat <- read_excel(path)
```

*dat* is in the required format. Refer to the help of the *initScenario()* function or to the <a href="#3. Input und Output">detailed description of the functions' in- and outputs</a> chapter for more details.

### Initializing an *optimLanduse* Object


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
# Initializing an optimLanduse-object
init <- initScenario(coefTable = dat,
                     uValue = 2,
                     optimisticRule = "expectation", 
                     # optimistic contribution of each indicator directly defined by their average 
                     fixDistance = NA) 
                     # 3 is the default
```

In consistence with Gosling et al., we chose the expectations of the indicator as optimistic outcomes *(optimisticRule = "expectation")* and the same uncertainty for the calculation of the averaged distances and the uncertainty space (*fixDistance = NA*, see equations 4 and 9 in Husmann et al. (n.d.) for more details).

### Solving the Initialized *optimLanduse* Object

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
# Solve the initialized optimLanduse object using the solveScenario() function                     
result <- solveScenario(x = init)

# Visualize the farm composition
result$landUse %>% gather(key = landCoverOption, value = landCoverShare, 1 : 6) %>% 
  mutate(portfolio = "Optimal farm composition",
         landCoverShare = landCoverShare * 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = landCoverShare, x = portfolio, fill = landCoverOption)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14)) +
  scale_fill_startrek() +
  labs(y = "Allocated share (%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 100)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title = ""))
```

The here optimized farm composition corresponds to figure 3 ($f_u=2$) in Gosling et al (2020). It can be seen that the farm composition that best fulfills all 10 indicators (i.e. the multi-criterial portfolio) practically only covers silvopasture and forest. The averaged observed farm portfolio in 2018 was, however, mainly composed of pasture and cropland and only small share of forest (circa 15 %). 

### Calculating the Portfolio Performances of the Optimized *optimLanduse* Object

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10}
# Performance calculations
performance <- calcPerformance(result)

performance$scenarioTable$performance <- performance$scenarioTable$performance * 100

ggplot(performance$scenarioTable,
       aes(x = indicator,
           y = performance,
           color = indicator)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept =
               min(performance$scenarioTable$performance),
             linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "",
                            nrow = 10)) +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position="right",
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = seq(1, 10)) +
  labs(y = "Min-max normalized indicator value (%)",
       x = "Indicators") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 101, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 101)) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=100), size = 1) + 
  annotate(geom = "Text", x = 6, y = 100, label = "Maximum achievable indicator level",
           vjust = -1)
```

Looking at the performances of this multi-criterial farm reveals, which indicators restrict the result. Here, the indicators 1 (financial stability), 3 (investment costs) and 8 (meeting household needs) are very close to each other. It can be followed that the portfolio is apparently restricted by these 3 indicators. In the worst-performing scenarios, these 3 indicators are commonly the worst performing indicators with the maximum distance of $\beta$. Or in other words, the guaranteed performance $1-\beta$ (lowestPerformance) is defined by one the these indicators. It can be interpreted that these 3 indicators are be worthwhile to consider in order to find strategy that developes the land-cover composition in a desired way. According to Gosling et al. (2020), this results were expectable, since the need for short-term liquidity mainly drives decisions of the farms of smallholder farmer. Intermediate-term economic success is not relevant until consumption of the household is secured. While the performances of indicator 1 differ relatively strong among the scenarios, the indicators 3 and 8 are similar in each scenario. It thus may be interesting to investigate the reasons for this particular worst-performing scenario of indicator 1.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10}
performance$beta
lowestPerformance <- performance$scenarioTable[order(performance$scenarioTable$performance,
                                decreasing = FALSE),]
head(lowestPerformance[,c(1 : 8, 31)], n = 9)
```

Further elaborating the packages' results indeed reveals that indicator 1 (financial stability) restricts the optimum and that the worst performing scenarios of indicator 3 (investment costs) are equal to the worst performing scenarios of indicator 1. $1-\beta$ results to this worst performances. All the worst performing scenarios have in common, that the outcome of silvopasture is pessimistic (Low) and the outcome of forest is optimistic (High). This relationship thus might be of interest when developing strategies or policies for a desired landscape development.

### Batch Analysis: Solving Multiple Uncertainty Values

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
applyDf <- data.frame(u = seq(0, 3, .5))

applyFun <- function(x) {
  init <- initScenario(dat, uValue = x, optimisticRule = "expectation", fixDistance = NA)
  result <- solveScenario(x = init)
  return(c(result$beta, as.matrix(result$landUse)))
}

applyDf <- cbind(applyDf,
                 t(apply(applyDf, 1, applyFun)))
                 
names(applyDf) <- c("u", "beta", names(result$landUse))

applyDf[, c(3 : 8)] <- applyDf[, c(3 : 8)] * 100

applyDf %>% gather(key = "land-cover option", value = "land-cover share", -u, -beta) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = `land-cover share`, x = u, fill = `land-cover option`)) + 
  geom_area(alpha = .8, color = "white") + theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Uncertainty level", y = "Allocated share (%)") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 100.01)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 3, 0.5),
                     limits = c(0, 3)) + 
  scale_fill_startrek() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "bottom")
```

Solving the porfolio under increasing assumptions for the untertainty levels (uValue, respectively $f_u$ in equation 4 (Husmann et al, n.d.) gives sensitivity of the land-cover compositions towards increasing aversion of risk of the farmer. The higher the uncertainty level, the higher the standard error of the mean (Gosling et al. use the s.e.m.; any other uncertainty measure will also be possible) of the indicator consequences on the land-cover options. Here, the composition of land-cover alternatives is quite stable. Only the small proportion of crops (circa 10 %) is interchanged with small proportions of pasture and plantation. Forest and silvopasture are practically not affected by the uncertainty level. The plot corresponds to figure 3 in Gosling et al. (2020).

### Leave-Indicators-Out-Analysis to Investigate the Indicators' Sensitivity

The sensitivity of the portfolio towards indicators or groups of indicators can be straightforwardly analysed by either leaving indicators of interest out and interpreting the response of the portfolio or, alternatively, by adding indicators of interest. Typical way to conduct sensitivity analyses is thus to compare distinct and independent optimization results.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning=FALSE}
dat_socioeconomic <- dat[dat$indicator != "Protecting soil resources" & dat$indicator !="Protecting water supply",]

init_socioeconomic <- initScenario(dat_socioeconomic,
                     uValue = 2,
                     optimisticRule = "expectation", 
                     fixDistance = NA) 

result_socioeconomic <- solveScenario(x = init_socioeconomic)

result_socioeconomic$landUse %>% gather(key = landCoverOption, value = landCoverShare, 1 : 6) %>% 
  mutate(portfolio = "Socio-economic",
         landCoverShare = landCoverShare * 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = landCoverShare, x = portfolio, fill = landCoverOption)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14)) +
  scale_fill_startrek() +
  labs(y = "Allocated share (%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 100)) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=""))
```

First leave-indicator-out example considers socio-economic indicators only (see also figure 5 of Gosling et al. (2020)). Expectedly, it corresponds to the above shown multiobjective portfolio, as all indicators relevant for the solution of the multiobjective portfolio are captured also in the socio-economic group.

```{r}
performance_socioeconomic <- calcPerformance(result_socioeconomic)

performance_socioeconomic$scenarioTable$performance <-
  performance_socioeconomic$scenarioTable$performance * 100

performance_socioeconomic$beta
lowestPerformance_socioeconomic <- performance_socioeconomic$scenarioTable[
  order(performance_socioeconomic$scenarioTable$performance,
        decreasing = FALSE),]

head(lowestPerformance_socioeconomic[,c(1 : 8, 31)], n = 9)
```

A look at the relevant performances reveals this finding. The result is still limited by financial stability and investment costs. Accordingly, also this socio-economic portfolio still does not perfectly reflects the actual observable land-cover composition, so that among these considered indicators further indicators appear to be relevant for the farmers.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning=FALSE}
dat_ecologic <- dat[dat$indicator %in% c("Protecting soil resources",
                                         "Protecting water supply"),]

init_ecologic <- initScenario(dat_ecologic,
                     uValue = 2,
                     optimisticRule = "expectation", 
                     fixDistance = NA) 

result_ecologic <- solveScenario(x = init_ecologic)

result_ecologic$landUse %>% gather(key = landCoverOption, value = landCoverShare, 1 : 6) %>% 
  mutate(portfolio = "Ecologic",
         landCoverShare = landCoverShare * 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = landCoverShare, x = portfolio, fill = landCoverOption)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14)) +
  scale_fill_startrek() +
  labs(y = "Allocated share (%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 100)) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=""))
```

The ecological indicator group, as the second example for leave-indicators-out analysis, leads to a portfolio covering forests only (corresponds to figure 5 of Gosling et al. (2020)). It can be followed that all contributions of all other land-cover alternatives in all scenarios (even the optimistic outcomes) to the ecological indicators are lower then the contribution of forest. This portfolio differs even more from the actually observed portfolio then the above shown multiobjective portfolio. Also the ecological indicators are apparently not sufficient to approximate the farmers' actual inceptions.

### Immediate  Economic Success

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning=FALSE}

dat_short <- dat[dat$indicator %in% c("Meeting household needs",
                                      "Liquidity"),]

init_short<- initScenario(dat_short,
                     uValue = 2,
                     optimisticRule = "expectation", 
                     fixDistance = NA) 

result_short <- solveScenario(x = init_short)

result_short$landUse %>% gather(key = landCoverOption, value = landCoverShare, 1 : 6) %>% 
  mutate(portfolio = "Immediate",
         landCoverShare = landCoverShare * 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = landCoverShare, x = portfolio, fill = landCoverOption)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") + 
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14)) +
  scale_fill_startrek() +
  labs(y = "Allocated share (%)") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), 
                     limits = c(0, 100)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) + 
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = ""))
```

The third example considers the prospective relevant indicators of the farmers only. Corresponding to figure 5 of Gosling et al. (2020), this scenario only consists of indicators that approximate the immediate economic success. And indeed this portfolio best reflects the portfolio observed in Eastern Panama. Following, these indicators best reflect the farmers' goals and perceptions in this area. The difference between this portfolio and the societal desired multiobjective portfolio highlight the requirements a land-cover alternative must fulfill to meet the farmers needs and goals. The silvopasture as defined in Gosling et al. (2020) may not serve the requirements of the farmers sufficiently. Since farmers rate liquidity and meeting household needs higher then long-term profit and economic stability, pasture outperforms silvopasture in the realistic scenario. Policies or development plans may consider these indicators as key elements when promoting a landscape development towards multifunctional landscapes.

### The use of fixDistance

Till now, the ...


```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}

#### uValue == 0 ####

# Initializing an optimLanduse-object using initScenario()
init_u0 <- initScenario(dat,
                     uValue = 0,
                     optimisticRule = "expectation", 
                     # optimistic contribution of each indicator directly defined by their average 
                     fixDistance = 3) 
                     # 3 is the default

                     limits = c(0, 100)) +
