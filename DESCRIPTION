Description: Robust multi-criteria land-allocation optimization that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty of the indicators in the objective function. Solves the problem of allocating scarce land to various land-use options with regard to multiple, coequal indicators. The method aims to find the land allocation that represents the indicator composition with the best possible trade-off under uncertainty. optimLanduse includes the actual optimization procedure as described by Knoke et al. (2016) <doi:10.1038/ncomms11877> and the post-hoc calculation of the portfolio performance as presented by Gosling et al. (2020) <doi:10.1007/s10457-020-00519-0>.
